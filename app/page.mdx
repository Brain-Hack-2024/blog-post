The acoustoelectric effect (AE) allows us to precisely target tiny areas‚Äîas small as a millimeter‚Äîand use focused ultrasound to single out the electric field of a region. Our goal is to use it to make brain-computer interfaces with 27,000x higher resolution.

<div class="custom-quote text-md"> We built a setup at home and replicated the AE effect. Our system is sensitive enough to measure acoustoelectric signals down to 250 nV with SNR > 1, despite no shielding or noise cancellation. </div>

*Radio analogy of EEG*

Imagine each neuron is an FM radio station, and they‚Äôre all blasting their tunes on the same channel. By being closer to one station, you can tune in a bit better, but the noise from all the other ones is still there. This is the problem that we face when recording EEG signals ‚Äî in order to make good neural prosthetics, we need to be able to read from a tiny subset of the neurons WITHOUT the noise of the others getting in the way. How can we do that?

Radio stations work by modulating their music with a reference signal, say 90.3 MHz. When you want to tune into that channel, you set your car radio to 90.3 MHz, and receive just that one station‚Äôs music.

Evidently, neurons don't normally "sing" at unique frequencies. But perhaps with external pertubation‚Äîultrasound‚Äîwe can make them do so.

### The acoustoelectric effect

The acoustoelectric effect is a phenomenon where ultrasound interacts with electric fields by changing the conductivity of a material.
<img class="w-[300px] m-auto" src="https://io0-questions.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2024/a2fedc6eb41684e34c637596d8cf4fda.jpeg"/>
<figcaption>Sketch map of acousto-electric effect <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Sketch-map-of-acousto-electric-effect_fig2_313809543">[source]</a></figcaption>

By applying ultrasound to a region, you can isolate signals from that particular region by looking for modulation at the ultrasound frequency ‚Äî typically > 500 kHz.

<img class="w-[350px] m-auto" src="https://io0-questions.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2024/4c0abdf374decaa95f7e9167beda10f2.jpeg"/>

Ultrasound can be focused down to a 1-mm focal point in the brain. By detecting the acoustoelectrically generated signals, we can in principle obtain the mm-level spatial resolution with the temporal resolution of EEG.

The main technical challenge is that the AE-generated signals are small; people recently worked out the governing equation for acoustoelectric fields (full derivation [here](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42005-023-01198-w/MediaObjects/42005_2023_1198_MOESM2_ESM.pdf)):

<img class="w-[250px] m-auto" src="https://io0-questions.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2024/ecf686c6783b6de4a492c0339f978022.png"/>
where k = 1 x 10^-9 [1/Pa].

This [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-023-01198-w) paper published last year provided a theoretical foundation for AE. Other people have shown AE in brain [phantoms](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/aa6ee7), and imaging of electric currents in the [heart](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8569939/pdf/nihms-1696551.pdf)<div class="annotation"></div>.


### Results
We were able to detect the acoustoelectric effect at very low pressures (~10 kPa), and confirmed that it was indeed acoustoelectric.


{/* The AE effect‚Äôs governing equation hints at a linear relationship between the applied electric field and the measured AE signal (as well as that for applied pressure). If we were to extrapolate what localized EEG signal amplitudes (20-100¬µV) would produce in AE signal amplitudes, we get an expected AE signal amplitude of approximately 80 pV per MPa pressure (extrapolated from 1625 nV measured at 50 kPa pressure and 20 Vpp electrical signal, applied to 50 ¬µV localized EEG signal).  */}

<figcaption>Magnitude of acoustoelectric effect with varying pressures</figcaption>

Data was obtained by looking at the difference frequency (500 kHz - 135.145 kHz* <div class="annotation">* We chose this frequency arbitrarily‚Äîa prime number for good luck.</div>), sweeping the lock-in frequency between 499,760 and 499,770 Hz. The amplitude of the AE effect was taken to be the peak within the range:

<img class="w-[350px] m-auto" src="https://io0-questions.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2024/cd39a7aa3e34e449784c4d13be31cc3c.png"/>
<figcaption>Lock-in amplifier readout over repeated frequency sweeps.</figcaption>

The presence of the peak helps us confirm the AE effect and reject spurious environmental signal.

We measured 120 mV at the frequency of the driving electric field, and 1625 nV at the difference frequency‚Äîthe AE signal. This corresponds to a modulation percentage of 0.00135% at 50 kPa, or 0.027% per MPa.

Brain signals have a magnitude of 10-100 ¬µV within the 0-10 Hz bandwidth at the surface of the scalp, so we expect the AE signal to have a magnitude of 2.7-27 nV per MPa. From the picture of the lock-in amplifier, our noise floor was about 100 nV, so about 1-2 orders of magnitude of noise reduction would be necessary to capture AE signals from the brain.

Is this doable? From an electronics perspective, very low-noise preamplifiers exist with less than 1 nV/‚àöHz noise*. <div class="annotation">*Samuel Groner, [A low noise laboratory-grade measurement preamplifier
](https://linearaudio.net/low-noise-laboratory-grade-measurement-preamplifier)</div>The more fundamental bound of our noise floor comes from Johnson noise in the brain itself, which is 4.5 nV/‚àöHz. Assuming a bandwidth of 10 Hz, this gives a noise floor of 14 nV, which would make the AE signal just barely detectable.

One idea to lower the noise floor would be to average over many electrodes. The uncorrelated Johnson noise would decrease as ‚àöN in the number of electrodes, while the correlated AE signal would increase linearly with N.



{/* This means that we would need to integrate for 10 seconds to get a 45 nV signal, which is close to the expected AE signal amplitude. */}

{/* This signal amplitude is quite low. It may be difficult to realize this measurement in humans for spatially localized EEG measurements, unless the acoustoelectric coupling constant can be increased. Note that safe maximum ultrasound pressure exposure limit is around 1 MPa, meaning continuous exposure limits would be even lower, meaning that in practical settings, naive AE measurements done within these exposure limits would likely result in AE signal amplitudes lower than 80 pV, which is difficult to detect even with lock-in amplifiers. For future experiments, it may be crucial to develop agents that could help increase the acoustoelectric coupling constant within the brain (perhaps infusable via the blood vessels). */}

#### Overview
Our home setup was very... bare-bones. We had no Faraday cage, no filtering, no pre-amp, not even an amplifier for the driving the transducer or applied electric field. We were able to get by by using continuous-wave ultrasound and with the magic of a _lock-in amplifier_. This handsome boy that we got on Ebay for $5k:

Pictured below are; a hydrophone, 4 copper wires in a 2x2 grid, and electrode pads. The hydrophone connects to an oscilloscope, and allows us to locate the highest pressure region. The four copper wires sticking through the holes are the applied electric field. Only two are powered at once using a signal generator. Having four allows us to pick any two and test different directions and locations. Most often the two closest to the hydrophone were used. The electrode pads pickup the modified electric field (due to the acousto-electric effect).

<figcaption class="text-center text-sm">Acousto-electric setup. Custom probe close-up.</figcaption>


The ultrasound single element probe is held in a 3D printed structure which also holds the acoustic lens right above it. In the setup, it is positioned at the bottom of the tank facing upwards. This is so we can have our custom probe free to move around from the surface, to locate the point of highest pressure.







#### Phantom
We used a water tank to model the brain. Water is a good acoustic model of the brain (1524 m/s in water, 1540 m/s in soft tissue), and 0.3% saline is a good conductivity model of the brain.

#### Acoustic field
We used a 500 kHz transducer (50 mm diameter, unfocused; Olympus A301s-SU). The ultrasound was driven straight from an arbitrary function generator (Siglent SDG1032X).

#### Electric field
The electric field was applied with a pair of copper wires, stripped bare for 5 mm at the ends, with 4.5 mm (1.5 wavelengths) inter-electrode spacing.
Crucially, we had to use a <span class="comic">second function generator</span> to drive the electric field. When the same function generator was used for both driving the ultrasound and electric field, we saw coupling between the signals that gave rise to a ‚Äúfake AE‚Äù effect, probably due to crosstalk between the function generator channels. The Siglent SDG1032X has -60 dBc of channel crosstalk which is greater than the AE effect that we observed. We also saw coupling from the signal generator to the lock in amplifier when they were powered on the same circuit, beyond just the manufacturer quoted -60dBc we also encountered some level of test setup related coupling and interference between wires. Steps were taken to mitigate this by twisting wires together to reduce EMI and shielding where appropriate.

We drove the function generator with 20V peak-to-peak, giving rise to a potential of 19.5V peak-to-peak across the electrodes. Our function generator has a finite output impedance of 50 Ohm and given the voltage drop would suggest the electrical resistance of the solution is around 1kOhm at 100 Hz.

#### Pressure Recording
We used an 0.5 mm needle hydrophone (Onda HNR 0500) to measure the incident pressure wave generated from the transducer. Given the hydrophone‚Äôs small size profile at the recording tip, we could localize where in space the pressure reached its maxima, and place our AE pickup electrodes at this position.

<i class="interlude">Interlude: speed of sound</i>

As a side-note, our setup also allowed us to measure the speed of sound in our saltwater medium. By recording from both the transducer‚Äôs driving signal generator and the hydrophone simultaneously, you can see the time delay between the start of the transducer sending out its acoustic waves and the hydrophone receiving this signal. By measuring the distance between the hydrophone and the transducer, and dividing this distance by the time delay, we can determine the speed of sound.

#### Acoustic Lenses

Surprisingly, acoustic lenses are hard to obtain. They‚Äôre one of those things that are offered on websites with a button that says ‚ÄúContact us to request a quote‚Äù. Lame üò©

Thankfully, you can just make your own. The ideal acoustic lens has the same impedance as water, but a different speed of sound. PDMS is perfect, but takes 3 weeks to ship on Amazon. So we went on a hunt for household materials that could be shaped into a sphere. Things we tried:

After none of the simple options worked, we designed our own to be 3D printed, both out of PLA and resin. Before the 3d prints came in we made molds and casted the lens out of candle wax.

The resin printed lenses were the best. The wax casted ones were difficult to make, and were very dependant on the type of wax used. The FDM printed PLA lenses had some air gaps between the 100% printed infill which causes lots of acoustic reflection.

#### Lock-in amplifier

<img width="300px" src="https://io0-questions.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2024/4f130df53537fd445b4c8e1a2fa663bf.png"/>
Analog signals are riddled with environmental noise‚Äînamely, thermal noise, line noise, and 1/f noise. We expect the acoustoelectric signal to be very small (on the order of nanovolts to microvolts), so naive, direct measurements will result in our signal being drowned out by noise.

By using the acoustoelectric effect, we've shifted our signal to 500 kHz, away from most sources of noise. We can use filters to get rid of noise contributions outside of this band. We expect the noise to be mostly thermal (white noise) in the bandwidth of interest and of course the all present 60 Hz noise from the grid.

Lock-in amplifiers are extreme examples of frequency-selective filters. Say our signal of interest occurs around a particular frequency f with some bandwidth b, but that this signal is polluted by lots of noise from various regions of the frequency spectrum. Our AE signal is such a signal, occurring only around the ultrasound frequency with bandwidth determined by EEG signal bandwidth. If we multiply this signal with another sinusoidal signal with frequency f through the use of an analog mixer, then we are able to produce a modulated signal. In this modulated signal, a large principal component of the signal would be in the original frequency band around f, but two side bands would also occur: one at the difference of the two input frequencies, and another at the sum (recall trig identities of multiplying two sinusoids!), which in this case are around 0 and 2f. By using a low-pass filter on this modulated output, we can strictly select for the component of the modulated signal around 0Hz.

In total, what the above operation achieves is a very tight band-pass filter that gets rid of noise from everywhere but around the frequency of our interest. This in turn greatly boosts our SNR and allows us to confidently detect signals down to the low-nanovolt range, around where we expect to see the AE signal. Furthermore, in the specific context of AE, recall how we added the ultrasound frequency f to our EEG signal, only to subtract it again through the use of the lock-in amplifier. We have effectively demodulated our AE signal back into the normal EEG frequency range, but this time with minimal noise (thanks to the lock-in amplifier) AND with spatial specificity (thanks to the AE effect)! Double wow!
